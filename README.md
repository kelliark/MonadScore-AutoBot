# Monadscore Auto Referral & Node Automation

This project provides an automated Python script to manage and run accounts on the Monadscore platform.

## Features

- **Auto Referral Mode:**
  - Registers new accounts with a referral code (from `codes.txt` or user input).
  - Claims three tasks in a randomized order.
  - Starts the node immediately after account creation.
  - Logs detailed, color-coded messages.
  - Saves account details to `accounts.json` and referral codes to `createdaccrefs.txt`.

- **Auto Run Node Mode:**
  - Automatically detects and processes all accounts in `accounts.json`.
  - Updates each nodeâ€™s status and retrieves total points via a login endpoint.
  - Supports proxy modes (rotating or private) with fallback to alternate proxies if one fails.
  - Runs in a continuous loop (cycles every hour) for 24/7 operation.
  - Displays colorful logs for each operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- VPS(Optional)
- Proxy(Optional but recommended)
